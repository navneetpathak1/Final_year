# API Configuration & Integration Guide

## Backend Connection Issue

If you're getting `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors, the frontend is trying to connect to the backend on the wrong port.

## How to Fix

1. **Check which port your backend is running on:**
   - Look at your terminal where the backend is running
   - It should show something like "Server running on http://localhost:XXXX"

2. **Update the API configuration:**
   - Open `src/config/api.ts`
   - Change the `BASE_URL` from `http://localhost:3003` to match your backend port
   - For example, if your backend is on port 3001, change it to `http://localhost:3001`

3. **Alternative: Use environment variable:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory
   - Add: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:YOUR_BACKEND_PORT`
   - Restart the frontend development server

## Common Backend Ports
- 3000 (default Node.js)
- 3001 (common alternative)
- 3003 (configured in backend)
- 5000 (Express default)
- 8000 (common development)

## Current Configuration
The frontend is currently configured to connect to: `http://localhost:3003`

Make sure your backend is running on this port, or update the configuration to match your backend's actual port.
